# Subatomic & Sub‑Subatomic Primer

## Quick definitions
- **Atom**: The smallest unit of an element that retains its chemical identity. It has a nucleus (protons + neutrons) surrounded by electrons in quantum states.
- **Electron**: A fundamental lepton with negative electric charge. It occupies quantum orbitals around nuclei and drives chemical bonding.
- **Proton**: A positively charged baryon in the nucleus. It is composed of three quarks (two up, one down) bound by the strong force.
- **Neutron**: A neutral baryon in the nucleus. It is composed of three quarks (one up, two down) and stabilizes the nucleus.

## Subatomic particles (core)
| Particle | Type | Charge | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Electron | Lepton (fundamental) | −1 | Electron cloud | Chemistry, bonding, electricity |
| Proton | Baryon (hadron) | +1 | Nucleus | Defines element (atomic number) |
| Neutron | Baryon (hadron) | 0 | Nucleus | Nuclear stability, isotopes |

## Sub‑subatomic particles (inside protons/neutrons)
| Particle | Type | Charge | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Up quark | Quark | +2/3 | Proton/neutron building block |
| Down quark | Quark | −1/3 | Proton/neutron building block |
| Gluon | Gauge boson | 0 | Binds quarks via the strong force |

## Quarks (flavors)
| Quark | Charge | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Up (u) | +2/3 | Light quark; with down quark forms protons/neutrons |
| Down (d) | −1/3 | Light quark; with up quark forms protons/neutrons |
| Charm (c) | +2/3 | Heavier, short‑lived |
| Strange (s) | −1/3 | Heavier, short‑lived |
| Top (t) | +2/3 | Heaviest, very short‑lived |
| Bottom (b) | −1/3 | Heavy, short‑lived |

## Leptons
| Lepton | Charge | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Electron (e⁻) | −1 | Stable; forms atoms |
| Muon (μ⁻) | −1 | Heavier electron; short‑lived |
| Tau (τ⁻) | −1 | Heaviest charged lepton; very short‑lived |
| Electron neutrino (νe) | 0 | Nearly massless; weakly interacting |
| Muon neutrino (νμ) | 0 | Nearly massless; weakly interacting |
| Tau neutrino (ντ) | 0 | Nearly massless; weakly interacting |

## Key particle families
| Family | Includes | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Quarks | u, d, c, s, t, b | Build hadrons (protons, neutrons, etc.) |
| Leptons | e, μ, τ, νe, νμ, ντ | Fundamental particles; do not feel strong force |
| Gauge bosons | photon, gluon, W, Z | Force carriers |

## Common composites
| Particle | Composition |
|---|---|
| Proton | u + u + d |
| Neutron | u + d + d |
| Pion (π⁺) | u + anti‑d |
| Pion (π⁻) | d + anti‑u |
| Pion (π⁰) | u + anti‑u or d + anti‑d |

## Forces relevant to atoms
| Force | Affects | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Electromagnetic | Electrons & protons | Attraction/repulsion, chemistry |
| Strong | Quarks & nucleons | Binds quarks and holds nucleus together |
| Weak | Certain decays | Changes particle types (beta decay) |
| Gravity | All mass | Negligible at atomic scale |

## “Negatron” — does it exist?
**Negatron** is a historical name for the electron, used to distinguish it from a “positron” (the electron’s antiparticle). It’s not a separate particle.

## Notes for Attract‑ion
- “Leptons” are a family that includes electrons, muons, taus, and neutrinos.
- The first orbital in hydrogen is the **1s orbital**, which is spherical in probability distribution.
- Stabilizing an orbital in the game can map to “forming a stable electron cloud.”
