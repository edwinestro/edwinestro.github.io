# Sodium (Na) — Knowledge

This folder documents **sodium as an element** with focus on **atomic identity and structure** (nucleus + electrons) and the measurable, intrinsic properties that distinguish it from other elements.

Scope notes:
- This is **not** about sodium’s chemistry with other elements, compounds, or organic/biological roles.
- Some quantities (e.g., ionization energy, common oxidation state) are included only as **atomic/elemental descriptors** tied to electron structure.
