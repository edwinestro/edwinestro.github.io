# Key Atomic / Elemental Properties — Sodium (Na)

This page lists commonly referenced intrinsic properties for identifying sodium as an element and comparing it across the periodic table.

## Periodic placement
- **Group:** 1 (alkali metals)
- **Period:** 3
- **Block:** s-block

## Electron structure identifiers
- **Electron configuration:** [Ne] 3s¹
- **Valence electrons:** 1

## Atomic-scale energetic quantities
(Values are typically given per mole of atoms; exact numbers depend on reference/measurement conventions.)

- **First ionization energy:** relatively low compared with most elements in period 3
  - Structural cause: removing the single 3s valence electron requires less energy than removing an electron from a filled shell.
- **Electronegativity (Pauling):** low to moderate (lower than many nonmetals)
- **Electron affinity:** small in magnitude compared with many nonmetals

## Sizes (atomic)
(Definitions vary: covalent radius vs metallic radius vs van der Waals radius.)

- **Atomic radius:** comparatively large for its period when using metallic-radius style definitions
- **Ionic radius (Na⁺):** much smaller than neutral Na due to loss of the 3s electron and increased effective nuclear attraction on remaining electrons

## Nuclear / isotopic notes
- **Natural sodium:** overwhelmingly \(^{23}\text{Na}\)
- **Nuclear spin (\(^{23}\text{Na}\))** is nonzero, which is relevant for certain spectroscopic identification methods (e.g., NMR), though this document does not cover chemistry.

## Macroscopic elemental form (non-chemical descriptors)
- **Standard state at room temperature:** solid
- **Appearance:** silvery metallic (fresh surface)
- **Density:** low for a metal
- **Crystal structure (room temperature):** body-centered cubic (bcc)
- **Melting point:** low relative to many metals
- **Boiling point:** moderate

## Spectral identification (atomic)
- **Characteristic emission lines:** strong yellow “D-lines” near 589 nm (commonly used for elemental identification)
  - These arise from electronic transitions involving sodium’s outer electron and are a classic signature of sodium atoms.
