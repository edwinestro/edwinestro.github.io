# How Sodium Differs From Other Elements

This page frames sodium’s “fingerprint” as an element: what uniquely identifies it and what distinguishes it from neighbors and lookalikes.

## The non-negotiable identifier
- **Sodium is the element with atomic number 11**.
  - Any atom with **11 protons** is sodium; any atom with a different proton count is a different element.

## Structural fingerprint (electron configuration)
- **[Ne] 3s¹** is sodium’s ground-state configuration.
  - This makes sodium an **s-block** element with **one valence electron**.

## Differentiation by periodic-table position
- **Versus neon (Z=10):** sodium begins a new period with an added shell (3s) and has one electron outside a noble-gas core.
- **Versus magnesium (Z=12):** magnesium is [Ne] 3s² (two valence electrons), whereas sodium is [Ne] 3s¹.
- **Versus lithium (Z=3):** lithium is also group 1 but is [He] 2s¹ (smaller atom; valence electron in n=2 rather than n=3).
- **Versus potassium (Z=19):** potassium is [Ar] 4s¹ (valence electron in n=4; larger and generally lower first ionization energy trend-wise).

## “One outer electron” consequences (kept atomic-level)
Without discussing compound formation details, sodium’s structure implies:
- **A strong tendency toward a +1 ionic state** (loss of the 3s electron) compared with many elements
- **Low first ionization energy** relative to most elements in its period
- **Large size trend within its period** (metallic-radius framing) due to shielding and the valence electron being in the 3rd shell

## Distinguishing observational signatures
- **Atomic emission:** bright yellow D-line region (~589 nm) is a common, distinctive signature of sodium atoms
- **Isotopic makeup:** natural sodium being dominated by \(^{23}\text{Na}\) is a notable identity detail compared with elements that have many abundant stable isotopes

## Quick checklist for identification
If you need to identify “is this sodium?” from atomic facts:
- Proton count = **11**
- Neutral electron count = **11**
- Ground configuration matches **[Ne] 3s¹**
- Shell count matches **2–8–1** (Bohr-style)
- Prominent yellow emission around **589 nm** (atomic spectrum)
