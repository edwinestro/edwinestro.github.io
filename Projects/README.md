# Projects

This folder is intentionally organized so it stays easy to browse.

## Structure

- `Projects/games/` — playable games (each is self-contained)
- `Projects/hubs/` — “unified” launchers / hubs (like Science Lab)
- `Projects/docs/` — optional future home for documents (some original docs remain in `Projects/` for backwards-compatible direct links)

## Backwards-compatible redirects

Some older URLs are preserved via tiny redirect stubs:

- `Projects/frost-signal/`
- `Projects/thermal-drift/`
- `Projects/science-lab/`

Those exist only so old links keep working; the real content lives in the folders above.
