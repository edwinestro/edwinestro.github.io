# INSTRUCTIONS

Use this file to deposit project-specific instructions, onboarding notes, and guidance for contributors or AI agents.

Guidelines
- Keep each instruction concise and actionable.
- Include context: entrypoint commands, build/test commands, and where to find key files.
- Tag sections using headings (`## Goals`, `## Commands`, `## Conventions`, `## Notes`).

Quick example

## Goals
- Implement user authentication and session management.

## Commands
- Install: `npm install`
- Test: `npm test`

## Conventions
- Commit messages: describe changes in present-tense, optionally use Conventional Commits.
- Tests: place unit tests next to implementation files.

Notes
- This repo already contains `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Update that file for agent-focused guidelines.

## Examples
- `examples/azure_story_agent.py`: a runnable sample that creates an agent and calls it using `azure-ai-projects`.
- `examples/feedback_processor.py`: simple normalization and difficulty categorization for player feedback.
