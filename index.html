    <h2 class="relationshipDesign">Relationship Design</h2>
    <p style="display: flex;justify-content: center;"><img class= "relationshipDesign" src="relationshipdesign.jpg" alt="Relations Relativity of relatives, drawing by Microsoft Copilot, prompted by Edwin Estrada."></p>
    <p>Relationship design is not "designed" in the traditional sense of creating a tangible product. Instead, it's a framework for approaching and building relationships in a thoughtful and intentional way. Think of it as a blueprint or a set of guiding principles that can be applied to various contexts, whether it's between a company and its customers, within a team of employees, or even in personal relationships.
    <p>The idea is that by understanding the principles of relationship design and applying them strategically, we can create stronger, more meaningful connections that benefit all parties involved. It's about moving beyond simply reacting to situations and instead proactively shaping the interactions we have with others.</p>
