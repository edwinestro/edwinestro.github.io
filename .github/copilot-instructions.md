# Copilot instructions (workspace)

## Effort level
- Default to **MEDIUM effort**.
  - Not minimal.
  - Not exhaustive.
  - Prefer a short plan + the smallest correct set of edits.

## Command transparency
- Before **every** terminal command or VS Code task, include a one-line explanation of what it does and why.

## Safety / policies
- Do **not** install Google Chrome (or any Chrome download from Google) for this workspace.
- Prefer existing system browsers and existing installed tooling.

## Engineering preferences
- Keep static pages build-free when possible.
- When removing large generated folders, also update `.gitignore` and provide a short “how to reinstall” note.
